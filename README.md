OneTimePad
==========

This project is a simple encoder and decoder for so-called "one-time pad ciphers" which were used during world war 2

**NOTE** This program only supports the letters from a-z and not any numbers or symbols, it's a very old project that was made for fun, please also note that I have no intention to fix this considering it wasn't the intention for it to support symbols and numbers from the beginning
